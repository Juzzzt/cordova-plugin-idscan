# cordova-plugin-idscan
A Cordova plugin for camera scanner and ID parser SDK's from IDScan.net (http://IDScan.net). Use it to scan drivers licenses and other IDs with the device camera, and parse out the data. Android and iOS are supported.

A valid license key is required for both SDKs from IDScan.net for the plugin to work. You only need keys for the platform you are using.

I wrote this code for my own project for DPM Solutions, Inc (http://dpmsinc.net). I provide it here for anyone to use as a starting point if they have a similar need.

Code examples to show usage will follow soon...
